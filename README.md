In this code you can see the solutions to 2 problems, the first is using the dataset Boston from the R packege MASS, in this one we adjust a model with a response variable crim and the other variables as explanatory variables. As you can see the methods that we use are ridge, lasso and elasticnet.

In the second problem we use the information of the library hdi from the datasets riboflavin$x and  riboflavin$y. As the other problem we use the same methods and then we compare the results obtained.
